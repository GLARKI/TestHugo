# **Smart Extended Reality Lab** *(smartXR-Lab)*
<div class=text-justify>

Welcome to our state-of-the-art lab in *Medical Mixed Reality (MMR)* from the *AI-guided Therapies group (https://ait.ikim.nrw)* of the *Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM)*, where cutting-edge technology converges with healthcare innovation. As we usher in a new era of medical advancements fueled by artificial intelligence, we seamlessly integrate the power of mixed reality to revolutionize patient care, training, and research. Our immersive lab environment combines virtual reality, augmented reality, and the expertise of medical professionals, transcending the boundaries of traditional medicine. Our lab serves as a dynamic hub for exploration, discovery, research, and collaboration.  
**We invite students, enthusiasts, and companies to join forces with us for exciting internship and collaboration opportunities.Contact us today to embark on this transformative journey.**

## **Equipment**
Equipped with advanced tools, our MMR-Lab empowers unique and innovative research for patient care. We have the following devices:
- **Structured Light 3D Scanners:** Artec Leo, Autoscan Inspec
- **3D Printers:** CREALITY SLA Printer
- **Mixed/Augmented Reality Glasses:** HTC VIVE PRO 1 & 2, Varjo XR-3, Microsoft HL2
- **Electromagnetic Tracking Systems:** NDI Aurora and 3D Guidance trakSTAR
- **Optical Tracking Systems:** OptiTrack system (PrimeX41), NDI Polaris Vega
- **Robots:** Aldebaran NOA and PEPPER Robots
- **Phantoms:** Karstadt models, GTSimulators Craniomaxillofacial surgery phantom
- **Ultrasound Scanner:** GEhealthcare Logiq E10 

Leveraging Artificial Intelligence, medical mixed reality, IT infrastructure, GPU clusters, and strong medical networks, we are at the forefront of groundbreaking advancements.


Some of **our current projects** entail markerless patient registration, 3D visualization of CT data and models directly into the patient, multi-user learning experiences, 3D databases (some of which are publicly available at https://medshapenet.ikim.nrw), inside-out tracking of patient and surgical instruments, and ongoing work on an augmented reality-assisted US-scanning approach including artificial intelligence support. In essence, our vision encompasses a promising future where we illuminate the unseen, bringing visibility to the previously imperceptible.
