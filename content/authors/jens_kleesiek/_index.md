The Focus of Jens's research is on applying self-supervised and weakly supervised learning paradigms to recognize clinically relevant patterns in large and complex data and the integration of multimodal data sources to enhance the decision-making process at the point of care. He studied medicine in Heidelberg and bioinformatics in Hamburg, where he obtained a Ph.D. in computer science in 2012. After training at the University Hospital Heidelberg and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), he received his board certification (Facharzt) in radiology, his habilitation (venia legendi), and specialization (Zusatzweiterbildung) in medical informatics.
