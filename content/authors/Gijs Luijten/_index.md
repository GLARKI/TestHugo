Gijs Luijten, my PhD focusses on Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) , my goal is to improve (surgical) diagnostics and interventions for maxillofacial surgery using cutting-edge technologies such as the HoloLens 2 and HTC Vive Pro. By merging 3D virtual medical data with the patient's physical space, I hope to develop AR applications that aid in surgical planning and intraoperative navigation. Here at IKIM I hope to also learn to implement Medical Machine Learning (MML) to strengthen the use of Mixed Reality (MR) glasses in clinical use. 
My most recent project involved creating a 3D dataset consisting of several surgical instruments for MR and MML applications. I used the photogrammetry scanners Artec Leo and Autoscan Inspec with their proprietary software and post processing using blender python to do so.
In the future I will be working with the GE Logiq E10rs Ultrasound device , I hope to link it with the HL2 and potentially include medical machine learning to aid with diagnostic research. We also acquired OptiTracker system and Electromagnetic Tracking system to further develop our MR applications.
My current project involves developing and investigating an AR tool for surgical visualization and navigation in maxillofacial surgery. Working in close collaboration with surgeons from the Medical University of Graz, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our AR tool in a real clinical setting. This interdisciplinary research project is carried out by the Graz University of Technology in cooperation with the Medical University of Graz and in close collaboration with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM) at the Essen University Hospital (UKE).
Even though earlier experience with using the HoloLens 1 for surgical planning and intra operative navigation, I still feel like a novice in all the mentioned areas. I'm convinced our team and my contagious enthousiasme and effort will make up for the current lack of know-how regarding implementing machine learning within augmented reality.
Through my work, I hope to contribute to making surgeries more precise, safer, available and faster, while reducing the mental demand for the surgeon by paving the way for companies. I believe that by leveraging the latest advancements in VR/AR technology, we (,researchers and companies,) can improve the quality of care for patients.
