Gijs Luijten is a PhD student focusing on Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR). His goal is to improve surgical diagnostics and interventions for maxillofacial surgery using cutting-edge technologies such as the HoloLens 2 and HTC Vive Pro. By merging 3D virtual medical data with the patient's physical space, Gijs aims to develop AR applications that aid in surgical planning and intraoperative navigation.

Gijs's most recent project involved creating a 3D dataset consisting of several surgical instruments for MR and MML applications. He used the photogrammetry scanners Artec Leo and Autoscan Inspec with their proprietary software and post-processing using Blender Python.

In the future, Gijs will be working with the GE Logiq E10rs Ultrasound device, with the aim of linking it with the HL2 and potentially including medical machine learning to aid with diagnostic research. The project also involves the acquisition of the OptiTracker system and Electromagnetic Tracking system to further develop MR applications.

Currently, Gijs is developing and investigating an AR tool for surgical visualization and navigation in maxillofacial surgery. This interdisciplinary research project is carried out by the Graz University of Technology in cooperation with the Medical University of Graz and in close collaboration with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM) at the Essen University Hospital (UKE).

Through his work, Gijs hopes to contribute to making surgeries more precise, safer, available, and faster, while reducing the mental demand for surgeons. He believes that by leveraging the latest advancements in VR/AR technology, researchers and companies can improve the quality of care for patients.
